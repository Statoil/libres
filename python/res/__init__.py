Ert - Ensemble Reservoir Tool - a package for reservoir modeling.

The res package itself has no code, but contains several subpackages:

res.job_queue:

The res package is based on wrapping the libriaries from the ERT C
code with ctypes; an essential part of ctypes approach is to load the
shared libraries with the ctypes.CDLL() function. The ctypes.CDLL()
function uses the standard methods of the operating system,
i.e. standard locations configured with ld.so.conf and the environment
variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
