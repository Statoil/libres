Misc:

 - implement legacy from ert.xxx [1, 20, 21, 22]
 - Setting up libres_util and moving ert_log there [13, 44, 48].
 - Added subst_list + block_fs functionality to res_util - moved from
   libecl [27, 68, 74].
 - Do not generate parameters.txt if no GEN_KW is specified.[89]
 - Started using RES_VERSION [91].
 - CONFIG_PATH subtitution settings - bug fixed[43, 96].

Build and test fixes:

 - Simple functionality to do post-install testing[3]
 - Use libecl as cmake target[6,15]
 - removed stale binaries [7, 9]
 - travis will build all repositories [23].
 - Travis + OSX [69, 72]
 - Remove equinor specific settings from build sytem [38].
 - Travis split for parallell builds [79].


Config refactor:

  In this release cycle there have been large amount of changes to the
  code configuring the ERT state; the purpose of these changes has
  been to prepare for further development with Everest. The main net
  change is that a new configuration object - res_config has been
  created ,which holds all the configuration subobjects:

    [10, 14, 35, 39, 45, 52, 54, 58-62, 66, 75]


Queue layer:

 - Improved logging [17, 37].
 - Funcionality to create a queue_config object copy [36].

 As part of this development cycle the job_dispatch script has been
 included in the libres distribution. There are many PR's related to
 this script:

    [28, 40, 41, 51, 53, 63, 64, 83, 84, 85,93, 94, 95, 97-99,
     101, 103, 108, 110]

 - Create a common run_id for one batch of simulations, and generally
   treat one batch of simulations as one unit, in a better way than
   previously: [42, 67]

 - Added PPU (Paay Per Use) code to LSF driver [71].
 - Workflow job PRE_SIMULATION_COPY [73, 88].
 - Allow to unset QUEUE_OPTION [87].
 - Jobs failing due to dead nodes are restarted [100].


Documentation:

  - Formatting bugs: [49, 50]
  - Removed doxygen + build rst [29]
